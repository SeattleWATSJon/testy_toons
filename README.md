Charles Henry Bennet

A frog he would a-wooing go,
whether his mother would let him or no.

off he set with his opera-hat.
On the road he met a rat.

"Pray, Mr. Rat, will you go with me,
kind Mrs. Mousey for to see?"

they soon arrived at Mousey's hall.
they gave a loud tap, and they gave a loud call.

"Pray, Mrs. Mouse, are you within?"
"Yes, kind sirs, and sitting to spin."

"Pray, Mr. Frog, will you give us a song?
let the subject be something that's not very long."

"Indeed, Mrs. Mouse," replied the Frog,
"A cold has made me hoarse as a hog."
