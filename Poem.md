__A Frog he would a-wooing go.__
__Charles Henry Bennet <br/ >_

A frog he would a-wooing go,
whether his mother would let him or no.

off he set with his opera-hat.
On the road he met a rat.

"Pray, Mr. Rat, will you go with me,
kind Mrs. Mousey for to see?"

they soon arrived at Mousey's hall.
they gave a loud tap, and they gave a loud call.

"Pray, Mrs. Mouse, are you within?"
"Yes, kind sirs, and sitting to spin."

"Pray, Mr. Frog, will you give us a song?
let the subject be something that's not very long."

"Indeed, Mrs. Mouse," replied the Frog,
"A cold has made me hoarse as a hog."

"Since you have caught cold, Mr. Frog," Mousey said,
"I'll sing you a song that I have just made."

As they were in glee and merrymaking,
A cat and ber kittens came tumbling in.

The Cat she seized the Rat by the crown,
The kittens they pulled the little Mouse down.

This put Mr. Frog in a terrible fright,
He took up his hat, and he wished them good night.

As Froggy was crossing it over a brook,
A likywhite Duck came and gobbled him up.

*So here is an end of one, two, three--
The Rat, the Mouse, and little Froggy.*
